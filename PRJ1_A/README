Executable Files: 
	   test.c
	   
Compiling Directions: 
	  There is a makefile in this directory that needs to be edited depending on which mode is being tested. Examples are shown below.
	    
	    MODE 1:	    all:
				gcc -Wall -Wshadow -g -lm -Wno-unused-variable  test.c  -o test 
			        valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full --verbose --log-file=memcheck.log ./test .5 .3 1 10000  && cat memcheck.log | tail -n 1 

	    MODE 2:	    all:
	    	 	    	gcc -Wall -Wshadow -g -lm -Wno-unused-variable  test.c  -o test 
				valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full --verbose --log-file=memcheck.log ./test testInput.txt   && cat memcheck.log | tail -n 1 

Output: 
	Program generates 4 performance parameters that are outputted to a file called proj1-a_output

	Parameters generated to file in order:
		   	     	Average Waiting Time of Type 0
				Average Waiting Time of Type 1
				Average Queue Length
				Average Utilization of CPU

Program Description: 
	This program generates a simulation that evaluates the performance of a single CPU computer system using a priority-based queuing system. This program uses a single FEL linked list that is has all arrivals generated for types 0 and 1 sorted in order of arrival time. Then using a two-queue system, one for type 0 and one for type 1, the program generates a simulation that outputs the performance parameters to a file.
